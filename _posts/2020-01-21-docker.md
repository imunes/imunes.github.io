## Changing the node docker image in IMUNES (on Linux)

Hello!

In on of our [latests commits](https://github.com/imunes/imunes/commit/db36ce475803ef025fb6b7078a4577dbb19e3470)
we added the possibility to choose the docker image IMUNES will load on every
node. Just open the configuration dialog on the node and write the docker image
name in the input box:

<img src="./images/another_docker_example.png" width="90%" alt="topology and dialog example">

Not every docker image will work: the image needs to adhere to certain rules
which will be explained in our
[FAQ](https://github.com/imunes/imunes/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions---FAQ).
