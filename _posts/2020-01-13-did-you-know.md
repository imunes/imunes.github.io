## Connecting IMUNES with the real machines

Hello!

We often get asked to explain how to connect the IMUNES topology to an outside
network or how to connect the machine running IMUNES to a running topology.
That is why we created two entries to our
[FAQ](https://github.com/imunes/imunes/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions---FAQ):
- How can I connect my host computer (the one running IMUNES) to an IMUNES topology?
- How can I connect a running IMUNES topology to the internet?

where we explained exactly how to do both of those things. Also, this
automatically answers the (another often asked) question:
- `What is the difference between External connection node and External interface
node?`
