## Using widgets in IMUNES

Hello!

There is a useful feature in IMUNES called `Widgets` that can be used when
running experiments in GUI. It works like this:
- Run any experiment with any number of nodes (e.g. PCs, Hosts or Routers).
- You want to know the routing tables of some nodes but don't want to write the
same command on every node.
- Click on the `Widgets` menu and select `IPv4 Routing table`
- Move your mouse to any of the nodes on canvas and the information about the
routes will be shown in the window.

If you want to run your own custom command, just select `Custom...` and write
your command into the input field and press `OK`. Move the mouse over the node
and your custom command will be executed. Be careful and don't execute any
long-running commands with large or infinite outputs or you will spam your node
and it will run out of resources.

We are also working on a new feature: `Link widgets` which will provide
information about the link under the mouse cursor.
