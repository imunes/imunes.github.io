## Blog update

Hello!

We hope to revive this blog with some new posts, news and updates in the near
future. IMUNES is still an active project and there is a lot of new and
interesting features since the last blog update even though we've been quiet.

For starters, we updated our [wiki page](https://github.com/imunes/imunes/wiki)
with some content from our old wiki page (it was a bit outdated), so check it
out. The example usage list is not yet complete, but the plan is to accompany
every example from [imunes-examples](http://github.com/imunes/imunes-examples)
and [imunes-security](http://github.com/imunes/imunes-security) with a wiki
entry.

Make sure to follow us on [our Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/imunes.net)
where we will publish links to this blog on every new blog post.

Stay tuned!
